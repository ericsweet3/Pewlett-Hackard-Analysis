# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

- For this analysis I performed several queries in order to find the number of employees that are retiring per job title, and then to find the number of employees that could qualify to join a mentor-ship program within the company. I put this analysis together using Postgres SQL.

## Analysis

After going through the data, I found 4 significant points that can be brought up for discussion:

1) The greatest amount of employees that are avaible for the mentor-ship program come from the General Staffers and Engineers.

2) There will mostly be a large vacancy and possible vacuum in experience throughout the company. The majority of the employees that are retiring have been with the company for a significant period of time, which makes the mentor-ship program all more important. When all the new employees come in, efficiency has a good possibility of dropping in the short term.

3) The company most likely needs to hire some more managers, since the data is telling me that there are not many currently employed. Only two with the title of manager are eligible for retirement.

4) Finally, over half of the employees that are retiring are coming from a Senior position, specifically General Staff members, and Senior Engineers. 

## Summary

- So, in conclusion, we see all the info laid out above on what is going to happen with retirement, but more questions still need to be asked. What more can we get from this info? For starters, we could additionally query for information on employees that are promotion-ready. The company has numerous positions that are about to vacant and they need to quickly find employees that are qualified to step into the Senior/Managerial positions. Another table that we could query for is possibly roles/titles that could be provisionally filled, or have the retirements be sectioned in a way where there isn't just one massive vacuum at once. As for the mentor-ship program, in my opinion, it does not look like it will be all that effective. According to the data, it will only be accounting for less than 1% of the new hires that will have to be made. And that's assuming that the retired employees will want to take part in that program.
